# Welcome to the Exam Scheduling Program

## About

The **Exam Scheduling Program** is a Python-based application designed to create efficient and conflict-free exam schedules for universities. By leveraging graph coloring algorithms, the program ensures:

- No two exams with overlapping participants are scheduled simultaneously.
- Each group has only one exam per day.
- Exams are not scheduled on weekends.

The schedule is saved as a CSV file, and optional visualizations in the form of tables can be generated for students, saved as PNG images.

## Features

- **Conflict-free scheduling** using graph coloring algorithms.
- **Customizable exam times** and start dates.
- **Support for CSV datasets** containing exam and participant data.
- **Weekend exclusion** to ensure exams are scheduled only on weekdays.
- **Visualized schedules** for students, saved as PNG files.
