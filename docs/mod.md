# Modules

## Overview

The program is structured into several modules, each responsible for a specific functionality:

- `main.py`: Entry point of the program.
- `scheduler.py`: Contains the scheduling algorithms.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data processing.
- `validation_tests/`: Directory containing validation test scripts.

## Module Details

### `main.py`

Handles the overall workflow, including data loading, invoking the scheduling algorithm, and outputting results.

### `scheduler.py`

Implements the graph coloring algorithm used to schedule exams without conflicts.

### `utils.py`

Provides helper functions for tasks such as data parsing and validation.

### `validation_tests/`

Contains scripts to validate the correctness and efficiency of the scheduling algorithm.
