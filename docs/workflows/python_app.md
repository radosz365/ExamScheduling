# Python Application CI Workflow

## Overview

This document explains how the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow is set up for the Python application in this project. The CI pipeline ensures code quality, correctness, and reliability by automating tasks such as dependency installation, code linting, running tests, and deploying the application.

---

## Workflow Description

The CI pipeline for the Python application includes the following steps:
1. Automatically trigger the workflow on commits, pull requests, or manual dispatch.
2. Install dependencies and set up the environment.
3. Run code linting to ensure adherence to coding standards.
4. Execute unit and integration tests.
5. Deploy the application (if applicable).

## Workflow File

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/python_app.yml` in the repository. Below is an overview of its configuration:

### Triggers

The workflow is triggered by:
- Pushes to any branch.
- Pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
- Manual workflow dispatch for on-demand execution.

### Steps

1. **Checkout Code**:
   - Clone the repository to the CI environment.

2. **Setup Python**:
   - Use the `actions/setup-python` GitHub Action to configure the Python runtime.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all required Python packages using `requirements.txt`.

4. **Lint the Code**:
   - Use tools such as `flake8` or `pylint` to check for coding standard violations.

5. **Run Tests**:
   - Use `pytest` to execute unit and integration tests, ensuring the application works as expected.

## Example Workflow File

Here is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow configuration for the Python application:

```yaml
name: Python Application CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Lint Code
        run: |
          pip install flake8
          flake8 .

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          pip install pytest
          pytest
