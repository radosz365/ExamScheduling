## Workflow Overview

The workflow is triggered on specific events related to the `documentation` and `main` branches. It ensures the documentation is built and deployed to GitHub Pages using MkDocs and the Material for MkDocs theme.

## Trigger Events

The workflow runs on the following events:

- **Push** events to:
  - `documentation` branch
  - `main` branch
- **Pull Requests** targeting the `main` branch

## Permissions

The workflow grants `contents: write` permission to allow deploying the documentation to GitHub Pages.

## Jobs

### Deploy Job

The `deploy` job is responsible for building and deploying the documentation. It runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.

### Steps

**1.Checkout the Repository**
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
This step checks out the repository code so the workflow can access the documentation files.

**2.Setup Python Environment**
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: 3.10
```
This step sets up a Python 3.10 environment required for MkDocs.

**3.Cache Python Dependencies**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    path: ~/.cache/pip
```
This step caches Python dependencies to speed up subsequent workflow runs.

**4.Install MkDocs and Plugins**
```yaml
- run: pip install --upgrade mkdocs-material
- run: pip install --upgrade mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]
```
These steps install the Material for MkDocs theme and the MkDocStrings plugin for generating API documentation.

**5.Deploy to GitHub Pages**
```yaml
- run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```
This step builds and deploys the documentation to the `gh-pages` branch, making it available on GitHub Pages.
